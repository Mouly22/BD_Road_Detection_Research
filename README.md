This project uses YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models to analyze traffic patterns in Bangladesh, trained on the RSUD20k dataset. It explores various image augmentation techniques like random cropping, scaling, and photometric distortions, assessing their impact on model performance and real-world applications in autonomous vehicle deployment.
